# DroneFaceTracking
Computer Vision - face tracking with DJI Tello mini drone

It works :D ..., face detection still has some issues in its accuracy

drone forward and backward movments are not yet implemented (be careful with those indoors)


You will need following libraries:

- djitellopy
- opencv-python
- numpy

(all available from pip)
